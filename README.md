Learning OJS 3.1: A Visual Guide to Open Journal Systems

This guide has been moved to our new [PKP Documentation Hub](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/) and its [associated repository](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs/). The new PKP Documentation Hub collects PKP's userguides and technical documentation into one easy to browse location, and will be the new focus of PKP's documentation effort going forward. 

The version of the guide you find here is no longer maintained, and this repository will be removed in the not too distant future. 

Learning OJS [can now be found in the Doc Hub here](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/), and the code [can be found in the repository here](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs/tree/master/learning-ojs).

If you are interested in contributing to PKP's documentation effort, you [can find information on doing so here](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/contributing/). (Our contribution instructions may not yet be 100% complete - please bear with us as we play a bit of catch-up!)

If you have any questions or concerns, you can contact us at [support@publicknowledgeproject.org](mailto:support@publicknowledgeproject.org).
